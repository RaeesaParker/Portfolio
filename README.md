My name is Raeesa Parker, and I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer. This repo holds the code for my [portfolio](https://raeesaparker.github.io/portfolio/). It's the place where you can find out a bit more about me and my skills. It also showcases some of the projects that I have previously worked on, as well as how to contact me.
